# Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

This project is an interactive **Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and machine learning techniques like **Linear Regression** and **Exponential Smoothing** for forecasting.

The dashboard allows users to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), demand forecasting, inventory optimization (Economic Order Quantity), and predictive modeling for shipping times. The user can upload their own supply chain data in CSV format or use synthetic data generated by the application.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution of Order Quantities
  - Lead Time vs Shipping Time Scatter Plot
  - Correlation Matrix of key metrics

- **Demand Forecasting**:
  - Forecasts the demand for selected products using Exponential Smoothing.
  - Visualizes the forecasted demand alongside historical data.

- **Inventory Optimization (EOQ)**:
  - Calculates the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) for each product.
  - Helps optimize inventory by balancing ordering and holding costs.

- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Uses Linear Regression to predict shipping time based on order quantity, lead time, and other factors.
  - Provides evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Installation

To run the dashboard locally, you need to have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the necessary packages.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-analytics-dashboard.git
   
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:


main.py is the main file 


bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Upload Your Own Dataset:

Use the sidebar to upload a CSV file containing your supply chain data. The CSV file must contain a column order_date in date format and other relevant columns such as product_id, order_quantity, lead_time, and shipping_time.
Use Synthetic Data:

If you don't have a dataset to upload, the app will automatically generate synthetic data to demonstrate the features.
Sidebar Navigation:

You can choose from the following analysis options:
Overview: Displays a sample of the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes data distributions and correlations.
Demand Forecast: Forecasts demand for a selected product.
Inventory Optimization: Calculates and shows the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) for each product.
Predictive Modeling: Predicts shipping times using a linear regression model.
Raw Data: Displays the raw data used in the analysis.
